# `JDE`

`JDE` stands for Josh's Development Environment. For the past few months this was a personal project but now it is currently undergoing major changes. One of these is renaming to `DIP` which stands for `Development In Progress`. The name is being changed because it better reflects the goal of the IDE which is that when using it, there is `Development In Progress`.
