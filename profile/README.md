>JDE-org can be shortened to JDE (Josh's Development Environment)

JDE was created by Joshua R. Yacktman, a Sophomore at Windermere Preperatory School (No affiliations) with the purpose of learning how IDE's work and to make a more custom codin gexperience tailored to his personal preferences. His work, along with that of his friends and Computer Science teacher, created JDE as it is today.
